- **Zettelkasten** is German for 'slip box' or 'card index'.

- The Zettelkasten method enables users to store and organize knowledge, extend their memory, and generate new connections and ideas. 

- The original system that we refer to was developed by the prolific German social theorist, [**Niklas Luhmann**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann), who viewed it as a "partner" in his writing process.[^1]
- Luhmann's Zettelkasten consisted of wooden boxes containing over 60,000 notes written on small slips of paper.

- In the modern age, we can use digital tools to emulate this system.
