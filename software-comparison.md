Here is the [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q3AyC3EyBFD90xOgfZOhAKqBozgoS-HdSH-YvfBO7Xw/edit#gid=227657679) to the Google Sheets version for viewing only. 

The reason we are using this editing method is because Google is not available in some areas of the world and we want everyone to be able to participate. Thanks in advance for your contributions!
