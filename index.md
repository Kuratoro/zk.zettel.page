### About
The idea for this public <zettelkasten> arose via the [r/Zettelkasten](https://reddit.com/r/Zettelkasten/) subreddit.

It is hosted by [/u/srid-](https://www.reddit.com/user/srid-) on Github ([source](https://github.com/Kuratoro/zk.zettel.page)) and is currently editable by anyone with a Github account (see <how-to-edit?cf>). 

This site is managed by the open source software called [Neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/), which is normally used from the command line with a text editor; however you can also edit this site directly on GitHub.

### Features
* [Anyone can contribute](https://github.com/srid/zk.zettel.page/edit/master/index.md) - if you need help with the editing/note creation process, feel free to contact us (<contact?cf>)
* Full [revision history in git](https://github.com/Kuratoro/zk.zettel.page/commits/master)
* View all the notes using the Category Tree view in the [index](z-index.html)
* [Search](search.html) function
