## Other uses

Some, or all of the basic principles of the Zettelkasten system can be applied to different uses.

### IDs and linking

Assigning unique IDs to other types of files to promote easier linking. Instead of copying the filepath to a file (which can be broken if you move the file), assign a unique ID and link to or mention it in the note. Search for the ID in your file explorer, and find your desired file.

### Permanent notes

A good principle in general, when writing notes for yourself. Incorporate future-proof elements that allow you to understand the note in the future, long after you have written the note.

### Use cases

- Keep a journal/daily note dump, which you can reference to as needed
- Gather and organize information related to projects or hobbies
